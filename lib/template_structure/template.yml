# Template structure for CV. The content should be in YAML format.
# If you are not familiar with YAML, refer: https://devhints.io/yaml
#
# Tip: If you already have a sample file like an exising Resume/CV PDF and you want to convert that to a YAML file based on the structure,
#  You could provide this template file and the PDF to an LLM like Claude.AI prompt to generate a new YAML file.
#  Example prompt: "Based on the given template_structure.yml file, create a resume.yml for data in Profile.pdf"
