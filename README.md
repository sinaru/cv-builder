# CvBuilder

*Build a beautiful CV PDF from a yaml text file.*

## Installation 

The tool needs to have `wkhtmltopdf` installed on the machine to generate the PDF. [See here](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html) on how to to install it.

üèóÔ∏è **[Following is WIP]**

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cv_builder'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle install
```
Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install cv_builder
```

## Usage

First we need to have a `yaml` file with the CV data. The yaml file supports following sections.

```yaml
version: 1
profile:
  name: # Your name
  title: # Your current job title
  about: # Some basic details about your experience

contact:
  github: # Github username
  mobile: # Mobile number
  email: # email address
  linkedin: # Linkedin username
  location:
    country: # country name
    city: # city name

skills:
  - area: # specific skill area you are specialized in
    items:
      - # sub item such as a technology you have the skill in under the specialized area

experiences:
  - title: # job title
  - organisation: # Name of the place you worked
  - location:
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
