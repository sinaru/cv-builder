*Build resume PDF from a yaml text file.*

ðŸš€ See it in action at [https://kamisaku.sinaru.com/](https://kamisaku.sinaru.com/?utm_source=github).

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/kamisaku.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/kamisaku)

See [examples](/examples) directory for sample generated PDF files based of [templates](/lib/templates).

## Templates
For a list of templates availble for PDF generation, check the [examples](/examples) directory where each directory name is a template name.

## Installation

This is a Ruby gem. So you can either install as a gem or clone the repo and use `bin/console` file run from terminal.

### Dependency Requirement
- Ruby 3.4.3
- Ensure that [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is installed.
- Chrome must be accessible from the terminal as `google-chrome`.
  - Kamisaku uses Chrome's [headless mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromium/headless/) to generate PDF files.
- Ensure `exiftool` is installed available in command line.
  - exiftool is used to soft remove metadata added by chrome in the PDF file.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'kamisaku'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle install
```
Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install kamisaku
```

## Usage

First we need to have a `yaml` file or a string with the correct schema data structure for the type of the PDF you are generating.

For the list of schemas, check `lib/schema` folder. E.g. For resume it is `lib/schema/resume/schema.yml`.

## Generating PDF

### Using terminal

Once you have the YAML text file, feed it into the `bin/console` and specify the output location.

```bash
bin/console -c examples/john_doe.yml -o examples/paper/john_doe.pdf -k resume -t paper
```

#### Bash options

- `-c` the YAML file
- `-o` output location for the PDF file including the name
- `-k` the type of document you want to generate
- `-t` template to use

### Using `PDF` class

```ruby
# Have a YAML string
yaml_str = "..."
# Create a hash
content_hash = Kamisaku::Helpers.yaml_str_to_content_hash(yaml_str)
# Validate the hash is correct. If there is any issue, it will raise a ` Kamisaku::Error ` exception.
Kamisaku::BaseContentValidator.new(content_hash:).validate!
# create a pdf instance
pdf = Kamisaku::PDF.new(content_hash:, category: "resume", template: "paper")
# create the PDF at given path
pdf.write_to('/path/to/generated_file.pdf')
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.

### Create or Update a template

To a new template, create a folder with template name at `lib/templates`. Additionally add the template name to `Kamisaku::TemplateHelpers::TEMPLATES` list.

Inside this folder, create `template.html.erb`.

The template will be exposed to a Ruby hash variable called `data`. This data represent the data in the YAML file as a hash. 
So you can use the Ruby hash methods to access and render the values.

In addition, the template helper methods defined at `lib/kamisaku/template_helpers.rb` will also be available to use directly. 

To test and build the template, you can run `scripts/rebuild_examples.rb -t <name of new template>`. This will create the PDF using the `lib/schema/example.yml`
and place it in `examples/` folder.

### Releasing a new gem version

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
